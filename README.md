# Cascading Epigenome-Wide Association Scan
This code uses the existing [MetaXcan](https://github.com/hakyimlab/MetaXcan) package to run a cascading analysis linking variation in genotype to traits through its effect on DNA methylation to gene expression.
## Installation
### Requirements
The dependencies for CEWAS can be installed via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) by running the following fommand from the `cewas/` directory:
```
conda env -f "cewas_env.yml"
```
The software help can then be accessed using:
```
conda activate cewas_env
python cewas.py -h
```
### Testing
Included is a script entitled `test_run.sh` which will run CEWAS on the subset of the [ROSMAP](https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/Explore/Studies?Study=syn3219045) data for chromosome 22, which is included in the `data` directory of this repository. It will output a file named `"test_results.txt"` which can be compared to the file labelled `"sample_output.txt"` as a sanity check that the program is working as intended:

```
./test_run.sh
diff -d test_results.txt sample_output.txt
```
If nothing is printed then the sample output matches the result generated by the test.

### Required data
As input, CEWAS requires several models that describe the association between genotype, methylation, and gene expression in a given tissue, as well as a reference for covariance between data comprising those models. All relevant resources can be downloaded from [WEB PAGE](FILL_IN) and then they can be placed in the `data/` directory of this package

Briefly the required data are:
* SNP to methylation predictDB, split by chromosome: This an SQLite database describing the association between genotype and DNA methylation in *cis*, and closely resembles the [format used in MetaXcan](https://github.com/hakyimlab/MetaXcan/wiki/Command-Line-Reference#spredixcanpy)`{name}_chr{1-22}.db"
* SNP to methylation covariance files, split by chromosome: This is a set of text files describing the covariance between SNPs in the model above, and they closely resemble the [format used in MetaXcan](https://github.com/hakyimlab/MetaXcan/wiki/Command-Line-Reference#spredixcanpy). The files should be named as `{name}_chr{1-22}.txt.gz", and must be gzipped and whitespace delimited.
* Methylation to expression predictDB: This is an SQLite data base that describes the association between DNA methylation and Gene expression in *cis*, and closely resembles the [format used in MetaXcan](https://github.com/hakyimlab/MetaXcan/wiki/Command-Line-Reference#spredixcanpy).
* Methylation to expression covariance: This is a text file describing covariance between DNA methylation probes used in the model above, and it closely resembles the [format used in MetaXcan](https://github.com/hakyimlab/MetaXcan/wiki/Command-Line-Reference#spredixcanpy). The file must be gzipped and whitespace delimited.
* Mapping/ENSEMBL mart file: This is a text file that is used in mapping ENSEMBL IDs from the genome build corresponding to the models above (here HG19), and is used in labelling genes with their HGNC id
